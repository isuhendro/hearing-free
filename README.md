TOGETHER, let's make high quality hearing-aid affordable to everyone who needs them

## Background
Both eyes and ears are two of the most important human basic sense.
With eyes, you could buy good high quality of eyeglasses with 200$.
With ears, you need at least 4000$ to buy the high quality a pair hearing aid.

## Definition of Hiqh Quality Hearing Aid
1. Able to amplify the volume based on frequency range
2. Comfortable to use
3. Low battery consumption

## Challenges
1. Programming DSP is not my cup of tea. We need electrical engineer to kickstart the original code that doing audio processing.
2. Building hardware is not my expertise either. Probably hardware industry could just reuse the available software and make the hearing aid available with affordable price.
